        Whether that was designing new logos for my favorite sports teams or
        album covers for a band that never actually made it into existence, I
        was always busy creating something.

          No needles, no haystacks. Error-free, easily maintainable code that is
          clear in its purpose and efficient in its execution makes me happy.

          in sauce.
