        A large part of why I fell in love with web development is that it offers me an artistic, creative outlet that also challenges me to constantly improve. There is never a shortage of problems to solve, ideas to explore and knowledge to gain.
        I am not afraid to fail (maybe even fall flat on my face, sometimes) because I believe that through friction comes growth.
        While it feels like my journey as a developer is only beginning, I have found myself gravitating towards a few core concepts when I am working on any project...
