        I've stumbled plenty of times along the way (maybe even fell flat on my
        face), but I embrace the adversity and use it as a catalyst for

          Error-free, organized and easily maintainable code. The only spaghetti
          I'm down with comes on a plate and it's covered in sauce.

        <Subtext>
          Diving headfirst into new ideas, with the courage to fail and the
          perseverance to get right back up and try again. Solving problems is
          the name of the game.

        <Subtext>
          Shout-out to the devs creating designs for all shapes and sizes.
          Seamless transition from mobile to desktop is key, with an emphasis on

          No squinting, shaking of the head, or questionable contrast between
          page elements. Intuitive site navigation, complimentary color schemes,
          and easily-digestible content.
