        Growing up, I was always passionate about and interested in all
        different forms of art. I was always creating, whether it was a logo for
        my non-existent hockey team or a sketch of an animal I just learned
        about.

        When I'm not coding, I'd love to sit around and talk about hockey (Go
        Avs!), animals, skateboarding, art, music, ancient history, true crime
        &amp; unsolved mysteries.

        On a rainy day, you might find me reading some Kurt Vonnegut or
        listening to a Ram Dass talk. I'm a sucker for a good story.
