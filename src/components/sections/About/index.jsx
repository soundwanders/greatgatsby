        I can't read binary and I'm not a programming wizard, but I care deeply about my work and I love what I do.

        Sometimes I feel like the hare, but most days I feel a lot more like the
        tortoise. Each day, I leave fresh footprints behind me,
        even if it's only a couple of steps.

          No needles, no haystacks. Error-free, maintainable code that is
          clear in its purpose and efficient in its execution makes me happy.
          The only spaghetti I enjoy is served on a plate and covered in sauce.

          Diving headfirst into exciting ideas, with the courage to fail
          miserably and the perseverance to get back up and try again. Solving

          No squinting, no head tilting. Complimentary color schemes, easy-to-digest content and 
          user interfaces that make sense. No need to overcomplicate things. Mostly because they're already 
          complicated enough!
