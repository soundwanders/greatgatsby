### ü•∏ What's Going On In Here?

1.  **`/src`**: This directory contains all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of site. Name `src` is a convention for ‚Äúsource code‚Äù.

2. **`/src/assets`**: This directory holds all media files such as images, icons and illustrations.

3. **`/components/common`**: This directory holds all common components which are resuable, shared UI elements such as Inputs or Buttons.

4. **`/components/content`**: This directory holds all unique components and styles for the page's individual sections. Each section is a standalone component that is combined with the others to create the page display.

5.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

6.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-browser/). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

7.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for any Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the title and description, which plugins you are using, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-config/) for more details).

8.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

9.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-ssr/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

10. **`jsconfig.json`**: The jsconfig file is used by VSCode to specify the root files and the configured options for the features of JavaScript language service.
